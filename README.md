# spinny

## This crate is now deprecated in favor of [`spin`](https://crates.io/crates/spin), which is now maintained again.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/jtnunley01/Beetle/_apis/build/status/not-a-seagull.spinny?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/jtnunley01/Beetle/_build/latest?definitionId=6&branchName=master)

Provides an `RwLock`-like struct that is `no_std` compatible and based on spinlocks. Made this because I couldn't find an equivalent that already existed that wasn't unmaintained.

# Thanks

Thank you to mvdnes for creating the original `spin` crate, which this crate is inspired by.
